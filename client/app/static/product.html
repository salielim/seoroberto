        <h3>MVP</h3>
        <p>This is a minimum viable product that demostrates the crawling functionality of the app.</p>

        <h3>HTTPS Crawling</h3>
        <p>This MVP only crawls https URLs for simplicity sake. In the actual app, both http and https URLs can be crawled.</p>

        <h3>8 URLs of Domain Crawled</h3>
        <p>As this is an MVP only 8 URLs from the domain are crawled for demostration purposes. This is to keep the database small. In the actual app, an infinite number of URLs can be crawled.</p>
